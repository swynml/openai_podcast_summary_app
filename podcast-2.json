We've not been together for a few weeks So nice we got plenty to talk about and we've been delivered a game where we could fill three or four podcasts in it I mean the dust is hardly settled Gary, but what are your thoughts? Yeah, I mean Grateful to have been a match like that the last game I did was Southampton Arsenal where there was a Brilliant finish and this game was such a strange game in so many ways But the ending was just spectacular and the type of ending That we all like to see where there's loads of goals loads of instant It's frantic managers look like they could get sent off pulling hamstrings Ryan Mason's charging down the touchline But such a bizarre game but probably sums up where both teams have been at this season that There are mess at times during games But then they've still got really talented players out on the pitch who deliver individual moments of absolute quality I mean Liverpool raced into a start. It looked as though Spurs were going to reprise that awful day last Sunday at Newcastle. Yeah, and look At three three hours you sort of stop here on the gantry and it doesn't excuse that first half an hour You can say well done to Spurs for coming back But you can also say look you're a shambolic mess and that that shouldn't happen because it happens Three times in the last week, you know, you've gone five down against Newcastle two down against Manchester United and three down against Liverpool So you're not learning you do it can happen once you can have freak games But not three times in a week. So for me Spurs A mess at the start of the match Liverpool really played well But you know, it shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that Liverpool start quick at Anfield. It's what they've done for I don't know probably the whole history It's always been the same here and Spurs just weren't ready for it at all And before the game I had some confidence that it would be better coming out of the Manchester United second half on Thursday So look, it was a real mess for Spurs and you know I laid into them for that first half an hour from the ownership to choice of managers the job The managers have done and the players out on the pitch. They all take responsibility When when things are as bad because in the last two or three four months, it's It's fallen to pieces and look it's happened. It's happened at Chelsea when they've obviously sacked a manager and then obviously it's just completely gone Same at Manchester United last season They're the two most recent examples that I can think of Where you think you can just get by to the end of the season and it just doesn't work like that And you can actually end up in a real sort of mess wanting the season to end immediately And at three and a half an hour 20 minutes Sorry, you know you're cutting to Daniel Levy you cut into the Spurs fans were walking out and heading back home on the m6 and m1 And you've got the players on the pitch you were thinking they want the ground to swallow them up So it was a real mess, but Liverpool started well and Deserved to be three and a little in front and you thought it was going to be at that point five six six Seven but something happened didn't it? I don't think either of us know what happened But even before Harry Kane got one goal back they were in with a couple of other chances as well Liverpool switch off. Yeah, Liverpool got complacent and started to play passive possession They started just to knock it around and think we'll just sort of if you like not penetrate anymore and not play with purpose There was real speed and tempo in the first 25 minutes And when you stop doing that you allow a team somehow to build Tottenham were done. They were on the ground, but you start to allow them to get up and recover and just all of a sudden Think well hang on a minute. They've not scored four yet They've not scored five before you know it you get a chance. I think sonnets the post and then They score and before you know it you've got a little bit of a an anxious feeling Can i say on that right hand side of the nightmare today from 40 minutes in how much is that down to the fact? Alexander-Arnold isn't playing as a normal right back. I was just going to say you have to connect the two they Can't keep papering over the cracks. You've got to deal with it properly You know every chance that Tottenham had it felt like came down that right hand side And I love Trent on the ball. I love I love him when he gets on the ball centrally I love him when he gets on the ball on the right hand side But you can't expect you know I would say let's if they were going to a back three And Robertson was tucking round and allowing Canati to go over to that side But they're not going to a back three Robertson's flying forward as well So you're expecting Canati to play right back and right centre back And that's too big an ask Um it can be done I had Yat Stam, I had Rio fernandt who were World-class defenders who could do it and quite often me and the other fullback whoever it was with Denny Serwin or Patrice Evera or Jon O'Shea or my brother would go forward. We'd both go forward together We'd fly on and we'd have Ronnie Jonsson and Yat Stam or Rio fernandt And the man you've had itch and they basically deal 2v2 with a midfield player back You know Roy Keane or Michael Carrick But if you're not quite right and you're not in quite a right season and your form's not right and you're giving teams Encouragement and you can see the goals. It just doesn't work like that You've got to be at the very top of your game to be able to get away with it and Liverpool aren't at that This moment in time and I've bought into some of the thought this season it exists It's right Liverpool's midfield needs dealing with or they're not getting protected like they used to the pressing they're not getting Protected like they used to the pressing they're not pressing as high They're not pressing and getting to the ball quickly Which means that you can get at the back four I played a lot in teams where you could get our back four But you still have to do your job better than Liverpool's defenders are doing They've got to do better than that. I hold them completely responsible today for me Look at Elliot and Jones in midfield with Fabinho were they magnificent? No, but they did not cause the problem of Liverpool conceding goals today They were all over the place at the back and they really did allow Tottenham back in this game They did and once that first goal went and you knew that something might happen But the game in the second half Martin and it was drifting away. I think we summarized it didn't we said I think no one wants to take the extra risk Tottenham didn't want to go get beat five And Liverpool were wary that it could go to three two and then it did go to three two Yeah And for 20 minutes the game was like that and you thought I bet both managers went and shook hands with each other on the byline On the touch line here if they could obviously they can't they probably would have done it and said let's get out of here You know Ryan you've not been battered and demoralized and sort of embarrassed And we've not if you like sort of if you like lost a three goal lead, but then once that second goal went in I almost knew that Tottenham would score again you're feeling you could sense it what I didn't anticipate Richard Alex It was that then they go and get a fourth Liverpool, but you know, it was a it was a good comeback from Spurs and they have to be I'm not gonna say congratulated They have to be what's less than congratulated, but you know, you give them some credit. I give them some credit for keeping going um Well, they they kept going for longer than they were really bad if you see what I mean Yeah, yeah, they kept going and look they didn't throw the towel in um they kept Plugging away. I think a confident ruthless J\u00fcrgen Klopp Liverpool would have destroyed them. I mean completely destroyed them They were lucky today that they weren't playing against a confident Liverpool defense and a confident Liverpool team because they would have been pulled apart here six seven eight like Liverpool did to Manchester United But Liverpool aren't in that moment They're not playing that well They play well in moments in games. They've got some good individuals, but structurally it's just not right So J\u00fcrgen Klopp will have to sort that out in the summer but for Spurs to get back into the game and at 3-3 which those celebrations were wild with a I wouldn't say half empty end, but I'd probably say Three quarters, you know, there was a big sort of lot of empty seats over this far side A lot of Spurs fans had gone home And they had a brilliant second half those Tottenham fans and then that I mean, I can't really summarize it any better than I did on commentary So that is the most Tottenham thing that I've ever seen. It's like, oh You've come back to 3-3 and then you go and concede a goal in the sort of 90s From an experienced player who Was obviously devastated by his leaving the club at the end of the season Yeah, and it's not the way to go out is it they've got a lot of experienced players Spurs Yeah, they've got a lot of experienced players and uh They should be doing a lot better. They should be doing a lot better. I mean look, it's a mistake The mistake he made actually, I think he's just not hoofing it up the field I think trying to play it back there really when the balls come into you and you just score the third goal You know, even if he kicks it forward there's two things one It's as far away from your goal as possible And the second thing is you might have to get a counter attack and get a fourth yourself If you're better off controlling it than doing what he did, you know Composing yourself and controlling it He sort of got stuck in between everything more and I feel sorry for him a little bit Because it happens and we you know, I don't see anyone give a goal away But it was it was a brilliant end to the game and something that I didn't expect I expected today somehow to see a game that where you know, cause Manchester United had won and Newcastle had won It was almost a little bit like it taken Champions League football out of the equation really hadn't it might not but I mean It looks that way now. It does you know, I think you know, Manchester United They've got a game at Brighton on Thursday that I thought if they drop points today and then you know Brighton do something Or if Newcastle lose somehow that Brighton won't revenge for Wembley. Yeah. Yeah, so something could happen But they're both in very good positions Newcastle and Manchester United and they deserved it over the season So I think they'll go and finish it off is what I think but you know, keep going if you're Liverpool We've got to keep those two teams honest Newcastle got Arsenal next week Manchester United got Brighton. So there's some difficult games to play um But it was an incredible finish to the game one that I didn't expect but just Summarize I think where both clubs are at at this moment in time They both need to get to summer as quickly as possible because it's uh Been below par for Spurs in the last two or three months for Liverpool for much of the season really You know compared to the standards that they've set Most of our podcasts have concluded but we're gonna do it now nowhere near the conclusion Are you telling us that Manchester City are gonna win the league? And now they're top of the league Yeah, and we've watched them up on these monitors here I've been asked on every Sky Sports production and every Sky Sports podcast for the last three months almost I think you were I think everyone was like queuing up like the amount of times I'd said it Um, yeah, I think they will win the league. Look, there's still there's still things can happen We have seen it where a team struggles like Arsenal have done in the last few weeks A powerful team goes in front of them, but then they wobble somehow and basically Arsenal nearly wobbled today to be fair Yeah, I actually thought they could draw today I said in midweek thought it'd be a tough game for them and it was a tough game really tough game I thought Fulham did well in the game and you just with when you're in the game against City with five ten minutes to go You're always thinking there can be a chance The the year that City won the league for the first time Manchester United got back in front of them. You thought here we go Manchester United and the power forward and they didn't they stumbled So Arsenal have got to keep going. It's about keeping teams honest at this time of the year I use that phrase a lot at the sort of four or five games to go What you'd hate to be in a position I had this in my first season at Manchester United where we didn't win at West Ham and then Liverpool Sorry, Blackburn didn't win at Liverpool. If we'd have won at West Ham, we'd have won the league So you just want to make sure you do your job And I think if you Arsenal make sure you're not looking at the team I think if you Arsenal make sure you're not looking back in three weeks thinking oh, we thought we'd lost it But if we beat Chelsea and we beat Newcastle We actually would have won it because City have dropped a couple of points along the way or a few points So Arsenal have got to somehow try and recover for Tuesday night against Chelsea and Sunday against Spurs We're doing the game next week. But at this moment in time City This is where it reminds me so much of the seasons where we were in March and he'd walk in he'd say right. I've had enough Stop messing around you've been bored for the last couple of months because there was no the games didn't feel important enough for us to get up for them That sounds really stupid I saw Gundogan's interview today it really resonated with me where he said that the the knots forest game was the game that sort of like meant It woke them up and I get that there was a game where that's enough now enough of that rubbish You know conceding to one of the bottom teams in the league with two minutes to go well done to nottingham forest But that's not what you do if you're at the top of the league I think that was the last game where Pep Guardiola was rotating and fidgeting around with his team and back four I think since then it's got really serious and they've had to switch on and that resonates with me from where we were at times So Alex Ferguson was a rotator. He would Give the squad and trust the squad but there come a point where it was like right This is it and I want seriousness from you now concentration and you'd really then start to get serious about everything And that that's what city have done. They've got serious about the work And top arsenal have wobbled. I didn't think they'd wobbled here because I think here we've just seen what can happen here and Strange things happen out there at an field So I thought that was a game where they play brilliant football But you know you're tuning up against west arm when you draw against the bottom of the league And then you go and not perform They didn't perform on wednesday. They didn't turn up and that That's really disappointing. That's the biggest game of their lives I don't buy into this gulf between the two teams point that's being made. That wasn't a gulf. That was a team not turning up freezing not having the sort of Ability to go into that game because of what had happened against southampton I think the southampton game had demoralized them and I don't blame them I you know, i've been there where I think that game really killed them on the friday night. That was a real blow hammer blow and I think that was difficult for them to get the minds right for the city game and City were just doing what they do, which is power forward in big games I said on this podcast a week or two ago city will be looking forward to this match pep guardiola will be loving this match Mikel arteta in his place had to look forward to it in the same way and it didn't happen erling harland 50 goals With his goal today in all competitions And i've been doing this job since 1974 and nobody's ever done that in the top division You're going back a long long time. I mean You know, we've we've had postcards of his success through the podcast um, but That really resonates for me is an amazing landmark 34 in the premier league which equals Uh a record that he's bound to break maybe on wednesday when we're at the game. Yeah We've become so accustomed to watching city over this last few years the passing the possession um The brilliance of it But if anyone ever asked me a question who would I rather watch of the two teams that were best in the league for four years I'd rather watch juergen klopp style of play I like The manchester city style of play now and this team far more than any of the other pep guardiola teams at city over the last four or five years Because of harland that powerhouse the imperfection of some of his touches and some of his play You know and that sounds really sort of quite derogatory in some ways But you know, it does bounce off him sometimes it is a little bit imperfect. He does take risks It's not as subtle and as precise as the rest of the players in the team. We've all got perfect Technical ability but he's a battering ram of a center forward with a brilliant finish with something really special And if you're watching him play you are watching something unique you are You are same with de broyna de broyna is unique but erling harland is truly unique a player that Very rarely graces this league. They're usually At barcelona or real madrid in time gone by Maybe in recent times they would be at paris san jamam But very rarely do we have a player that you would regard as being one of the top couple in the world As they arrive we normally have players who are emerging to that after signing in this league Um, it's usually that those players would go to those other clubs that i've mentioned But I do think there is a world star here who has come as a world star and he's performing like a world star And at this moment in time City have got the treble in their hands They've got some difficult games against real madrid coming up in the champions league and they've got a cup final against manchester united But on the form that they're in they're very very dangerous and erling harland is He's He's got the finishing of cain The power of rune he's got he's got you know, he's unbelievable He's unbelievable even the brazilian ronaldo the power he used to have when he ran that explosion off the mark He's almost like four players in one and something that During the season many a question including myself Does pep actually like having a player like that? No, because you've watched it sometimes it's looked a little bit um Dysfunctional from how pep normally likes to play but it looks like that harman is coming at the right point in the season where Those moments that he delivers Contribute so much more to city than when they had the perfection of everybody else that played and there were people questioning Obviously zinchenko leave being allowed to leave and jesus being allowed to leave But when you saw rakanji at left back the other night defending like he did against saca And you've seen ake in the last few weeks and then you see alvarez today play like he did all harland Over the season you're starting to think you know, you think pep knows what he's doing Um, you know, I think that spanister city at left back of looks really really Uh strong since they've gone to a kanji and ake Whereas before when they had a maybe jauquin cello there or zinchenko or rico lewis. That's not been as solid So, you know pep in the end has got there and probably knew what he had in his squad before we did I mean, I was I was amazed the other night that kanji played at left back But then he had the most incredible fantastic match against saca kept saca as quiet as anybody i've seen and while kyle walker the same With martinelli, so it's all come right for city at the right time They started to purr at the moment where you want to and harland is just a sensation I hesitate to ask you about mantras united because you didn't watch the game today. No, um, but bruno fernandez good a Very important goal but was also the one bit you have seen of it was uh Uh on twitter one of his teammates having a bit of a go at him and that brought a smile to you No, I think it sums bruno fernandez up his man's united most effective player his man's united's best player But then I think every man's united fan and probably every player is thinking just stop moaning it's like I mean i'm own a lot but I didn't do on the pitch You know what I mean at my own players and so that's probably the perfect You know summary of of bruno fernandez today is a match winner when man's united don't have him in the team They drop levels like you wouldn't believe and we've seen that recently against severe um So no, he's an important. It's an important win that for man's united today bruno fernandez is a star His assistant goals record is incredible from the position that he plays Uh, he always wants the ball. He's got the courage to take the ball. He always fights for everything in a game But maybe one of his teammates or two maybe do Stop moaning now and then and that probably to be fair something it'll take on board if we don't name the culprit go on the social media and you'll find it so Yeah, um a couple of things I want to talk to you about um crystal palace and roy hodgson Yeah, your old boss Um has suddenly turned to be an attacking coach And i've been the goals have been flying in and he's um been a short-term fix Yeah, absolutely and I have to say that it looks like roy's having the time of his life Almost like he's come back in with the freedom the experience. He knows the players which thinks really important And he is like a father figure to those players. They trust him Um, you know, I worked with roy for four years and the players will never say a bad word about him because they trust him He's serious about his work um He's got them into shape. He's got them scoring goals Yeah, we know that patrick vera is a little unlucky that his fixtures he had before he finished were the toughest fixtures and that the fixtures since were More winnable, but we've seen around the teams like lester and everton and leads and forest um Losing games we've seen baumuth go like that. I mean, that's an incredible story We must come on to that But roy hodgson's done a wonderful job just at a time where I think crystal palace needed some experience Steve parish and the other owners didn't want to risk The thought of going down and thought we just need somebody who's basically a surefire bet to get us uh Well maintain our status in this league and that's what's happened and he's an excellent coach and he's had a fantastic career It'll be interesting to see now what he and what crystal palace do in respect of at the end of the season and when it's something whether it's a A cameo that's going to turn into something a little bit longer I'm going to go a little bit longer, but we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens Gary o'neill and baumuth they lost nothing nil here baumuth before gary o'neill took over Of course scott parker was up very early in the season and gary with no Elite managerly experience and where they are now is um, it is a candidate for manager of the year I was just going to say yeah, he probably won't get it But he is a candidate for manager of the year because we all had baumuth going down I don't know anybody who four or five weeks ago wasn't saying that the words south hampton and baumuth are gone And then they were thinking like well is it forest is it lester is it everton is it lead is it west ham is it crystal palace? All those other teams that would get mentioned I'm stunned. I'm absolutely stunned by what's happened down at baumuth. It is an incredible um performance Um It's going to mean that a club that's bigger on paper is going to go and it makes it a really intriguing next Three or four weeks at the bottom of the league. There'll be some real desperation down there everton Leeds nots forest west ham are still down there Um that game tomorrow night on monday night football lester v everton is monumental. Um, it's a huge game uh and The league title looks like it's gonna go towards city But the at the bottom you're in none the wiser Let's finish off by talking about some of you who's lived some of his life in baumuth Graham sueness has said goodbye to sky sports today his last appearance on super sunday. Um, Graham has a great expression about himself as a proper player. He was a proper manager He's been a proper pundit hasn't he absolutely martin, you know and I first joined sky um graham was Um the senior pundit and still is the senior pundit speaks with such authority gravitas uh conviction As an incredible way of delivering lines you can debate with him And it's no holds barred. He can put you on the floor sometimes As he did on the pitch. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he can and he's not worried to say the unthinkable or the unpopular, um But then you'll shake your hand at the end of a show and you come back the next week and you'll do it again And that's what i've respected most about graham in this last 10 12 years I think that he's one of the very best Um that i've ever seen doing the job and some thing that you know I and other sort of younger pundits when we first come into it would learn so much from he is a brilliant brilliant, um I've been a brilliant brilliant pundit. I had some fantastic Nights listening to his stories in the early days when we go away on champions league And he would have the meal the night before Particularly when him and glenn hodl were there sat there at the table and they had two very different views on football But he was really interested in listening to them both and I thought those studios think jamie redknot was in the studio with them at times Or rude hullet they always would debate about style of play glenn obviously wanted to see possession and passing through midfield and Graham would see the game slightly different about making sure you you you get the You know you get wired in you get stuck in but he also played the game as well Um, but really sorry to see him go. He's been a fantastic pundit a fantastic person at sky Um, I wish him all the very best in the future. I think we're weaker for not having him here next season Um because of what he brings but that's life. We understand that people move on it's football But I do wish him all the very best. He's been fantastic with me Um, I think my last Battle with him was here a few weeks ago when manchus united got beat seven nil and I had the audacity to say that I didn't think livipool played that well Which he jumped upon Um, I still think I was right You sort of don't tend to win sometimes with graham and that's that's the nature of it Uh, but yeah, I really do wish him all the best He's been fantastic to work with over this last 10 11 years. I echo all of that and what an appropriate Venue an appropriate game Yeah him to finish with you. Yeah, I mean obviously he's seen so much here, um over his lifetime and obviously the two teams I mean graham obviously I think was at spurs in his early days He's obviously watched spurs here today and then obviously he was at anfield He obviously was a great player here and managed the club as well So for him to finish here on a game like that today whereby the two teams that obviously has an affinity with as well There he is just on our screens I think will be a big moment and there'll be a nice video. I think coming up in the next five or six minutes of You know his best times at sky or his moments at sky which i'm sure will get a lot of air time Yeah, go and look for it at the end when you've finished with the podcast and we've finished today gary pleasure to talk to you as always Thanks martin.
